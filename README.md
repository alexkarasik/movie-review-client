# Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and Jquery for this project.

My app is a Movie review/forum for Users to discuss the films of one  of my favorite directors, Werner Herzog. Users are able to look at a list of his films and write their personal reviews of them, based on the ID's.

# User Stories

As a User, I want to be able to sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and change passwords because I want to be able to create and own my own reviews.

As a user, I want to be able to look at all Movies in our database.

As a user, I want to see all the Reviews in our database to know what movies were made by this director.

As a user I want to have the ability to create, update or destroy my own reviews, because I am making a log of my own preferences.

# Development Process and Planning
I started making the back end, making sure my reviews and movies were CRUDable and testing them after setting up the routes, controllers, serializers and migrations.
Then I wrote out my HTML, and created events and handlers for each of the functions I want to make the User expeperience clear and CRUDable.

# Unsolved problems
There are quite a few things I would like to add to this project. The biggest thing that stands out is that I would like to be able to add images and the movie trailers as part of the descriptions of the movies themselves. I would like to figure out how to add my data with a 3rd party API as well.
